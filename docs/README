API documentation
=================
All three programming interfaces (C/perl/python) have their API's documented 
in doxygen markup.  All input/output paramaters for each function should
have a definition.

The documentation can be created by running "make doxygen" in the root dir.

The output path is determined by the variable DOXYGEN_PATH.

Once generated, it is then viewable thru a web browser.

cmdline documentation
=====================
The cmdline is documented through each commands individual help text file.

Each command will have a listing of the required and optional arguments.

These files can be found in ecmd-core/cmd/help and each extensions cmd/help
directory

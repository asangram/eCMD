eCMD Global Options

All of these options are parsed for by eCMD in ecmdCommandArgs.  The help file
for every command has which of these options is supported.

Targeting Parms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The default for the targeting parms is 0 if it is not given on the command line.

        -a#             Operate on all levels of targeting with same value.
                        This is the same as specifying -k# -n# -s# -p# -t# -c#
                        NOTE: Using this option is mutually exculsive of the
                        other targeting parms.

        -k#             Specify which cage to act on.

        -n#             Specify which node to act on.

        -s#             Specify which slot to act on.

        -p#             Specify which chip position to act on.

        -c#             Specify which chipUnit to act on.

        -t#             Specify which thread to act on.
                        This has the extra option alive, to act on only alive threads.

In addition to specifying a single target to act with the # parm, these other options
are available:
        0,3,4           Do specifically 0, 3 and 4
        2..7            Do the range from 2 to 7
        0..2,5          Do the range of 0 to 2, and 5 as well
        all             Do all targets at a specific level
        ft              Do the first target at a specific level
        lt              Do the last target at a specific level
        et              Do the even targets at a specific level
        ot              Do the odd targets at a specific level

"-all" Support:  By using "-all" on the cmdline, all of the individual targets are set to all.  So "-all" is the equivalent of "-kall -nall -sall -pall -call -tall"

Hex input is also supported for numeric entry.  To use hex, prefix any number with 0x or 0X.  

Multiple target fields can be separated by colons (":") with the same rules as above.


Examples:
       -s2 -pall        Will operate on slot 2 and all positions found behind it (on cage0, node 0)
       -aft             Will operate on the very first target in the system.
                        The same as -kft -nft -sft -pft -cft -tft
       -k3 -n2 -p0,2    Will operate positions 0 and 2 in node 2 of cage 3
       -n1 -pet -cot    Will operate on node 1, even postions then odd chipUnits of
                        those even positions (on cage 0)
       -k2:n1 -s0x10FF -pall   Will operate on all of the positions of slot 0x10FF (decimal 4351) in node 1 of cage 2   

Print Control
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        -quiet          Turn off normal and informational printing

        -quieterror     Turn off error printing to the screen.  Intended for use
                        with programs that will use ecmdGetErrorMsg to handle
                        errors.

Miscellaneous 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        -coe            Continue On Error. If an error occurs, continues to the next target
                        instead of exiting.  Any error status is returned at the end.

        -exist          Instead of looping over configured targets in the system, loop
                        over existing targets.  This could return targets not functional
                        in the system!
